PDF BOOKMARK SAMPLE 
 
Sample Date:  May 2001 
Prepared by:  Accelio Present Applied Technology 
Created and Tested Using:  •  Accelio Present Central 5.4 
•  Accelio Present Output Designer 5.4 
Features Demonstrated:  •  Primary bookmarks in a PDF file. 
•  Secondary bookmarks in a PDF file. 
Overview 
This sample consists of a simple form containing four distinct fields. The data file contains eight 
separate records. 
By default, the data file will produce a PDF file containing eight separate pages. The selective 
use of the bookmark file will produce the same PDF with a separate pane containing 
bookmarks. This screenshot of the sample output shows a PDF file with bookmarks. 
 
The left pane displays the available bookmarks for this PDF. You may need to enable the 
display of bookmarks in Adobe Acrobat Reader by clicking Window > Show Bookmarks. 
Selecting a date from the left pane displays the corresponding page within the document. 
Note that the index has been sorted according to the specification in the bookmark file, and that 
pages within the file are created according to the original order in the data file.
